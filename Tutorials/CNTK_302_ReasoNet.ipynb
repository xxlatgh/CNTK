    "# CNTK 302: ReasoNet for Machine Comprehension\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction and Background\n",
    "\n",
    "In CNTK 204 tutorial, one show how to generate a sequence from an input sequence of data. We have introduced the \"attention mechanism\" which results in superior performance. Research has shown how the human brain pays selective attention to certain parts of the enormous amount of information that comes our way by filtering out extraneous data that is not currently of import for the task at hand. One can extend this concept to neural networks. This approach – commonly referred to as “attention” is used as a building block for other machine understanding tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is an advancement over attention based mechanisms shown earlier. The Reasoning Network [ReasoNet](https://posenhuang.github.io/papers/reasonet_iclr_2017.pdf) has achieved industry-leading results in reading comprehension. The ReasoNet model is a leading model with ExactMatch (EM) and F1 scores (being 73.42 and 81.75, respectively at the time of creation of this tutorial) on the Stanford Question Answering Dataset [SQuAD](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this tutorial is to show how we can teach machines to read, process and comprehend natural language documents. Genuine reading comprehension is extremely challenging as it requires understanding of the documents and performing reasoning involving different context. Enabling a machine to answer a question based on provided passage has gained significant attention enabled by powerful deep learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of [CNN data](https://github.com/deepmind/rc-data) where there are 4 components: (1) query (q), (2) document (d), (3) candidate list (a) and (4) the true answer (A), in this tutorial, we train a model that enables machine comprehension with state-of-the-art performance where we find out the answer for a question given a paragraph text. We will be training our model on triplets as a collection of query, passage and answer."

    ">>__*3:*__  @entity3 ( @entity2 ) @entity1 heavyweight boxing champion @entity0 has an important title defense coming up , but his thoughts continue to be dominated by the ongoing fight for democracy in @entity8 . speaking to @entity2 from his @entity3 training base ahead of the april 25 showdown with @entity12 challenger @entity11 in @entity13 , @entity0 said the crisis in his homeland has left him shocked and upset . \" my country is unfortunately suffering in the war with @entity18 -- not that @entity8 tried to give any aggression to any other nation , in this particular case @entity18 , unfortunately it 's the other way around , \" @entity0 told @entity2 . \" i never thought that our brother folk is going to have war with us , so that @entity8 and @entity18 are going to be divided with blood , \" he added . \" unfortunately , we do n't know how far it 's going to go and how worse it 's going to get . the aggression , in the military presence of ( @entity18 ) soldiers and military equipment in my country , @entity8 , is upsetting . \" @entity0 is the reigning @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 champion and has , alongside older brother @entity37 , dominated the heavyweight division in the 21st century . @entity37 , who retired from boxing in 2013 , is a prominent figure in @entity8 politics . the 43 - year - old has led the @entity43 since 2010 and was elected mayor of @entity45 in may last year . tensions in the former @entity48 state remain high despite a ceasefire agreed in february as @entity50 , led by @entity52 chancellor @entity51 and president of france @entity53 , tries to broker a peace deal between the two sides . the crisis in @entity8 began in november 2013 when former president @entity58 scuttled a trade deal with the @entity60 in favor of forging closer economic ties with @entity18 . the move triggered a wave of anti-government protests which came to a head @entity45 's @entity67 in february 2014 when clashes between protesters and government security forces left around 100 dead . the following month , @entity18 troops entered @entity8 's @entity74 peninsula before @entity18 president @entity75 completed the annexation of @entity74 -- a move denounced by most of the world as illegitimate -- after citizens of the region had voted in favor of leaving @entity8 in a referendum . more than 5,000 people have been killed in the conflict to date . \" people are dying in @entity8 every single day , \" @entity0 said . \" i do not want to see it , nobody wants to see it ... it 's hard to believe these days something like that in @entity50 -- and @entity8 is @entity50 -- can happen . \" but with the backing of the international community , @entity0 is confident @entity8 can forge a democratic future rather than slide back towards a @entity48 - era style dictatorship . \" i really wish and want this conflict to be solved and it can only be solved with @entity98 help , \" he said . \" @entity8 is looking forward to becoming a democratic country and live under @entity98 democracy . this is our decision and this is our will to get what we want . \" if somebody wants to try to put ( us ) back to the @entity48 times and be part of the @entity108 , we disagree with that . we want to be in freedom . \" we have achieved many things in moving forward and showed to the world that we do not want to live under a dictatorship . \" @entity0 , whose comments were made as part of a wide - ranging interview for @entity2 's @entity118 series , is routinely kept abreast of developments in @entity8 by brother @entity37 but also returns home whenever he can . \" as much time as i can spend , i am there in the @entity8 . it 's not like i am getting the news from mass media and making my own adjustments and judgments on what 's going on . it 's an actual presence and understanding from the inside ... it obviously affects my life , it affects the life of my family . \" the 39 - year - old and his fiancée @entity137 celebrated happier times last december when the @entity12 actress gave birth to a baby daughter , @entity142 . \" i need to get used to it that i 'm a father , which is really exciting . i hope i 'm going to have a big family with multiple kids , \" he said . @entity0 is n't sure when he 'll finally hang up his gloves . \" i do n't know how long i can last ... motivation and health have to be there to continue . \" but after leaving almost all his boxing opponents battered and bruised -- the @entity8 is seeking an impressive 18th consecutive title defense against @entity11 -- @entity0 is keen to carry on fighting his own and his country 's corner in the opposite way outside the ring . \" i just really want that we 'll have less violence in the world ... i hope in peace we can do anything , but if we have war then it 's definitely going to leave us dull and numb . \" watch @entity0 's @entity118 interview on @entity2 's @entity165 on wednesday april 8 at 1130 , 1245 , 1445 , 2130 , 2245 and 2345 and thursday april 9 at 0445 ( all times gmt ) and here online .<br/>\n",

    "\n",
    "Single-turn reasoning models use attention mechanisms Error! Reference source not found. with associated deep learning models to emphasize speciﬁc parts of the document which are relevant to the query. However, for many sophisticated comprehension tasks, a human reader often revisits some speciﬁc passage or the question to grasp a better understanding of the problem. Recent work has made use of multiple turns to infer the relation between query, document, and answer [9][10][11]. This approach has been demonstrated to produce superior results. We summarize the essence of the original paper by Shen et. Al. [6]  in the remainder of this section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Existing multi-turn models have a ﬁxed number of hops or iterations in their inference, i.e., with predetermined reasoning depth, without regard to the complexity of each individual query or document. However, a human reader may read a document several times and stop when the question in mind has been adequately understood (reaching a certain level of confidence) or terminate after a certain number of tries. \n",
    "\n",
    "ReasoNet tries to mimic the inference process of human readers. With a question in mind, ReasoNet reads a document repeatedly, each time focusing on different parts of the document until a satisfactory answer is found or formed. Moreover, unlike previous approaches using ﬁxed numbers of hops or iterations, ReasoNet introduces a termination state in the inference. This state can decide whether to continue the inference to the next turn after digesting intermediate information, or to terminate the whole inference when it concludes that existing information is sufﬁcient to yield an answer. The number of turns is dynamically modeled by both the document and the query, and will be learned automatically according to the difﬁculty of the problem.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this implementation we apply a special policy to train the embedding layer. For entities in the context/paragraph, we just use fixed random vectors as the embedding of them and won't update them during training stage. For other words in the context/paragraph and query, we will initialize the embedding using glorot uniform initialization or loading from an existing embedding matrix, e.g. GloVe embedding and they will be updated during training stage. To approch this, we can't simply adopt existing initializer or embedding lookup funciton in CNTK, and we implimented  `create_random_matrix` and `load_embedding` to create *random initialization matrix* and *load existing embedding matrix*. The class `uniform_initializer` will be used by `load_embedding` to initialize *enities* and other words that can't be found in the existing embedding matrix (looking up table)."

    "The dynamic axes are particularly important in the world of recurrent neural networks. Instead of having to decide a maximum sequence length ahead of time, padding your sequences to that size, and wasting computation, CNTK's dynamic axes allow for variable sequence lengths that are automatically packed in minibatches to be as efficient as possible.\n",

    "When setting up sequences, there are two dynamic axes that are important to consider. The first is the batch axis, which is the axis along which multiple sequences are batched. The second is the dynamic axis particular to that sequence. The latter is specific to a particular input because of variable sequence lengths in your data. In CNTK, we use the dynamic axe name to idenitify different dynamic axes, and all sequence oprations between different variables require them have the same dynamic axes which means they must have the same length on all the axes. \n",
    "\n",
    "In ReasoNet networks, we have five input streams/sequences: *query*, *paragraph*, *label*, *entity id*, *entity indicator*, where *entity id* and *entity indicator* are helper sequences. *Query*, *paragraph* and *entity id* have different sequence lengths so they have different sequence dynamic axis. *label* and *entity id* have the same sequence length as *paragraph*, so they share the same dynamic axis. As a result, there will be two sequence_axes, *sourceAxis* and *contextAxis* when we create the model.

    "### Loss function (Contractive Reward)\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the signiﬁcant challenges ReasoNet faces is how to design an efﬁcient training method, since the termination state is discrete and not connected to the ﬁnal output. This prohibits the canonical back-propagation method from being directly applied to train ReasoNet. Inspired by [12][13], this challenge is tackled by a novel deep reinforcement learning method called Contrastive Reward (CR) to successfully train ReasoNet.\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge for CNTK (and most other deep learning toolkits) to implement Contractive Rewards is that the derivative of the loss cannot be directly computed based on the loss formula via Chain-Rule. \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "R= \\sum_{t,a}(π_{(t,a)}(\\frac{r_{t,a}}{b} - 1)\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "where, \n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "b= \\sum_{t,a}(π_{t,a} r_{t,a})\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "is referenced in the formula as a **constant**. Otherwise the **backward derivative of loss will always be zero**. Thus, we introduce a new operator, **StopGradient**, in CNTK to tackle that challenge. With StopGradient, we can just take the forward output of $b$ in the computation of the loss while keeping it as a constant during backward propagation. *Note*: The use of StopGradient is an internal to CTNK and made transparent to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike traditional reinforcement learning optimization methods using a global variable to capture rewards, CR utilizes an instance-based reward baseline assignment. Using StopGradient enables us to factor part of the forward value in the loss computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Experiments show the superiority of CR in both training speed and accuracy. Finally, by accounting for a dynamic termination state during inference and applying the proposed deep reinforcement learning optimization method, ReasoNet can achieve the state-of-the-art results in machine comprehension datasets, including unstructured CNN and Daily Mail datasets, and a proposed structured Graph Reachability dataset.\n",

Further more, they found using $\\left(\\frac{r_T}{b}-1\\right)$ in replace of $\\left(r_T-b\\right)$ will lead to a better convergence.\n",

year - old has led the @entity43 since 2010 and was elected mayor of @entity45 in may last year . tensions in the former @entity48 state remain high despite a ceasefire agreed in february as @entity50 , led by @entity52 chancellor @entity51 and president of france @entity53 , tries to broker a peace deal between the two sides . the crisis in @entity8 began in november 2013 when former president @entity58 scuttled a trade deal with the @entity60 in favor of forging closer economic ties with @entity18 . the move triggered a wave of anti-government protests which came to a head @entity45 's @entity67 in february 2014 when clashes between protesters and government security forces left around 100 dead . the following month , @entity18 troops entered @entity8 's @entity74 peninsula before @entity18 president @entity75 completed the annexation of @entity74 -- a move denounced by most of the world as illegitimate -- after citizens of the region had voted in favor of leaving @entity8 in a referendum . more than 5,000 people have been killed in the conflict to date . \" people are dying in @entity8 every single day , \" @entity0 said . \" i do not want to see it , nobody wants to see it ... it 's hard to believe these days something like that in @entity50 -- and @entity8 is @entity50 -- can happen . \" but with the backing of the international community , @entity0 is confident @entity8 can forge a democratic future rather than slide back towards a @entity48 - era style dictatorship . \" i really wish and want this conflict to be solved and it can only be solved with @entity98 help , \" he said . \" @entity8 is looking forward to becoming a democratic country and live under @entity98 democracy . this is our decision and this is our will to get what we want . \" if somebody wants to try to put ( us ) back to the @entity48 times and be part of the @entity108 , we disagree with that . we want to be in freedom . \" we have achieved many things in moving forward and showed to the world that we do not want to live under a dictatorship . \" @entity0 , whose comments were made as part of a wide - ranging interview for @entity2 's @entity118 series , is routinely kept abreast of developments in @entity8 by brother @entity37 but also returns home whenever he can . \" as much time as i can spend , i am there in the @entity8 . it 's not like i am getting the news from mass media and making my own adjustments and judgments on what 's going on . it 's an actual presence and understanding from the inside ... it obviously affects my life , it affects the life of my family . \" the 39 - year - old and his fiancée @entity137 celebrated happier times last december when the @entity12 actress gave birth to a baby daughter , @entity142 . \" i need to get used to it that i 'm a father , which is really exciting . i hope i 'm going to have a big family with multiple kids , \" he said . @entity0 is n't sure when he 'll finally hang up his gloves . \" i do n't know how long i can last ... motivation and health have to be there to continue . \" but after leaving almost all his boxing opponents battered and bruised -- the @entity8 is seeking an impressive 18th consecutive title defense against @entity11 -- @entity0 is keen to carry on fighting his own and his country 's corner in the opposite way outside the ring . \" i just really want that we 'll have less violence in the world ... i hope in peace we can do anything , but if we have war then it 's definitely going to leave us dull and numb . \" watch @entity0 's @entity118 interview on @entity2 's @entity165 on wednesday april 8 at 1130 , 1245 , 1445 , 2130 , 2245 and 2345 and thursday april 9 at 0445 ( all times gmt ) and here online .\n",

      "[1] Doc: ( @entity0 ) it was a masterful performance . i watched in awe on thursday as cardiothoracic surgeon and celebrity talk show host @entity4 surfed a gargantuan wave of criticism to shore . i should have expected that dr. @entity4 would keep standing in the face of charges from a group of colleagues that he pushed \" quack treatments ... for personal financial gain . \" and thanks to the ineptitude of his critics this round , he may have actually boosted his media empire . but he 's increasingly serving himself at a cost to @entity24 and @entity25 . if dr. @entity4 was ever going to go down , surely his ship would 've sunk last summer in the wake of his disastrous testimony before a @entity30 subcommittee . he was ostensibly invited to speak as an expert witness about bogus weight loss products , but sen. @entity33 , chairwoman of the @entity30 's @entity34 , instead made him her chief example of the kind of snake oil salesmen that keep hoodwinking consumers into thinking there 's a quick fix for their expanding waistlines . @entity43 subsequently eviscerated @entity4 on his hit @entity45 show \" @entity46 . \" in a segment that 's now garnered over 6 million @entity49 views , @entity43 makes quick work of @entity4 's claims about \" magic \" green coffee beans , a product that 's now earned a $ 9 million @entity55 fine for its false marketing claims . despite his utter humiliation , dr. @entity4 soldiered on , with his university and hospital continuing to stand by him , and with @entity61 and @entity62 , who co-produce \" the dr. @entity64 , \" fully behind his program . if the @entity30 could n't bring him down , what made this particular collection of 10 doctors think they could do it with their recent letter to @entity24 , where dr. @entity4 holds a tenured professorship and administrative position in the @entity74 and performs his duties at @entity24 - affiliated @entity25 ? the doctors insisted that the university must disassociate itself from dr. @entity4 for his now well - established tendency to promote cure - alls more befitting 1915 than 2015 . turnabout is fair play . and @entity4 and his producers responded with alacrity , slicing and dicing his ill - prepared challengers with an investigative segment that would 've made \" @entity86 \" proud . he and his team score points with me for pointing out the media 's own failings in delightedly circulating the letter without looking into the backgrounds of anyone involved . it 's a simple matter to question ulterior motives when the letter itself takes pains to highlight @entity4 's critical attitude toward gmo foods , not one of his greatest indiscretions by a long shot . dr. @entity4 after all has conducted experiments on his tv audience , apparently in violation of the rules of his own academic medical center . he has a propensity to spout laughably definitive statements with little to no scientific support , such as his advice that \" every kid in @entity115 ought to be on @entity117 fatty acids and @entity118 from either the sun or a pill \" because this regimen will help them withstand concussions . instead of mounting a defense of the indefensible claims he delivers so easily and often , dr. @entity4 routed his critics by quickly pivoting to the undercurrents of their letter . he correctly pointed out that several of the letter 's signatories are @entity133 industry shills . one of the writers campaigned against a @entity136 proposition requiring @entity133 labeling , and one of the bunch even served time for felony medicaid fraud . these characters never stood a chance in tipping the scales against dr. @entity4 , but they got their headlines nonetheless . dr. @entity4 was able to transition their critique of his apparent disregard for science on his program into an easily vanquished attack on his straightforward stand for consumers ' right to accurate product labeling . when my wife first brought the letter to my attention , i immediately wanted to know whether these were @entity24 physicians . this whole affair would 've played out quite differently if a slate of credible colleagues based at his own institution were coming out against dr. oz. so far they 've made no demand for his resignation , though some colleagues made their discomfort public in an op - ed for @entity169 last week . dr. @entity4 is well - aware that some colleagues question him , discussing that tension in his @entity172 op - ed. he says he does n't expect all physicians to understand his approach to health promotion , where he 's willing to entertain just about everything , even seances . the closed , physician - only social network @entity179 issued dr. @entity4 numerous questions from its membership , none of which dr. @entity4 answered . they are revelatory of physician attitudes toward him nonetheless . one doc asked dr. @entity4 how he could keep up with the fast - changing world of cardiothoracic surgery and carry on with his show every weekday . another asked him how he knows so much about so many areas of medicine -- \" @entity193 certified n all these areas ? \" . both types of questions show the profound disconnect between most physicians , who tend not to speak unless they are certain in their expertise on a topic , and the way the media industry works . dr. @entity4 's show does n't require he stay up late at night prepping for the next day -- he has an office full of production staff behind him . let 's take it as a given that not every physician across @entity115 , or at @entity24 , has to agree with what dr. @entity4 says on his program . i certainly do n't . does he have the right to say it ? yes , but not without challenge . a real case can be made that dr. @entity4 has used his media megaphone to do harm as well as good . he is now a polarizing figure , and while @entity24 should be lauded for protecting the free speech of its academic staff , the equation with dr. @entity4 is becoming increasingly complex . he 's no longer simply good pr for the @entity24 and @entity25 , which is often featured in his show . the letter writers were correct about one thing : @entity24 's reputation is now linked with the @entity226 standing right out in front .\n",

( no. ) here 's a journey from the @entity32 to the @entity33 , around the moon and the @entity36 's tilting axis , to @entity37 and the @entity38 to try to explain the complex holiday called @entity0 . and you 'll learn to how to color easter eggs with kool - aid . let 's start at the @entity32 . at the @entity32 , @entity44 began with @entity45 last week and culminated in @entity46 with multiple celebrations in between to mark the final week of @entity8 's mortal life . @entity8 rode on the back of a donkey into @entity52 on @entity45 where crowds celebrated him as the @entity55 and laid down palm branches in his path . but the crowd and the @entity59 turned on him in the course of the week , according to the @entity61 , leading to his crucifixion and resurrection . rain sprinkled down on worshipers standing under a sea of umbrellas as they gathered in a gray @entity68 on sunday to partake in the outdoor services held by @entity71 . afterward , the @entity72 took a moment to tell the world to do right those in need in his @entity78 address . @entity71 lamented the suffering of people in many of the conflicts around the globe . from @entity84 to @entity85 , @entity86 to @entity87 , he expressed hope that violence would end . @entity71 also does n't put on airs . this week he washed the feet of believers , repeating the @entity61 account of a woman , a sinner , washing @entity8 ' feet and anointing them with oil . let 's move on to old @entity52 , the birthplace of @entity0 . the church of the @entity100 in old @entity52 unifies the spot where @entity8 was crucified -- @entity102 -- with his tomb , or sepulcher . on sunday , @entity105 and @entity106 @entity18 celebrated the resurrection there . in the morning , the @entity109 , the archbishop of @entity52 , entered the basilica . then mass was held followed by a procession . but a large group of indigenous @entity18 did n't join them . it 's not quite @entity0 yet in the @entity33 for @entity116 . they 'll be celebrating a week from now , because they determine @entity0 's date by a different calendar than @entity18 -- the @entity120 . which brings us to the question of how astronomy is used to determine the date of @entity46 . a blood moon appeared in the sky early saturday , right between @entity12 and @entity46 and during @entity128 . just a coincidence ? not completely , because the dates for both @entity128 -- the @entity132 holiday celebrating the deliverance from slavery in @entity135 -- and @entity0 are determined by moon phases , according to @entity137 . @entity0 's timing is related to @entity128 , because @entity8 was crucified around then , according to the @entity61 . many jewish holidays , including @entity128 , fall on full moon , which is also a prerequisite for a lunar eclipse , the event that turns the moon a blood red color . since the timing of moon phases does n't jibe with @entity36 's orbit -- which is how we determine the length of a year now -- @entity128 's exact date moves around -- and so does @entity0 's . when @entity3 bishops first convened at the @entity153 in the year 325 , they made a rule to determine the date of @entity0 , so as to fairly reliably pin it to @entity128 : it would fall on the first sunday after the first full moon following the vernal equinox . that 's the day in march when @entity36 's axis reaches a midpoint between winter and summer and the day and night are of equal length . but ... if the full moon fell on sunday , @entity0 would be pushed down a week . confusing ? it got worse . when the @entity164 moved from the @entity120 to the gregorian calendar , @entity116 stayed put , resulting in -- usually -- two separate dates for @entity0 . in 1997 , the @entity167 pushed for a unified method of determining a date based on astronomical occurrences . it did n't catch on . but some odd @entity0 trappings that popped up after the @entity173 very much have -- the eggs and the bunny . the bunny is an egg - laying pagan that worships the moon . that 's one notion of its origins , but probably not the actual one . @entity37 immigrants appear to have brought it to @entity185 in the 1700s . @entity37 historians are not clear on its beginnings , but the first known mention of the bunny and the eggs in writing was in 1682 . professor of medicine @entity195 described in his paper \" @entity198 ovis paschalibus , \" or \" on easter eggs , \" a custom in the @entity202 region involving a bunny and eggs , according to @entity37 public television . some also credit the region with inadvertently inventing the christmas tree . but @entity195 left out any explanation of how the tradition arose , leading to a number of theories in @entity37 . one common idea : during @entity214 , people had to abstain from eating eggs , but hens kept on laying them , so farmers boiled and preserved them . by the time @entity0 rolled around , they were practically swimming in them . they had to figure out something to do with them when the holiday hit . play hide and seek with them ; color them ; give them as gifts . parents may have invented the bunny as a playful explanation for children on where the @entity0 eggs came from . if you 're coloring eggs this year , here 's an interesting tip. instead of stinking up your place with the smell of vinegar , use @entity241 , @entity243 science geek @entity242 suggests . and it appears to work . just use a whole packet in a small glass of hot water and gently lay the eggs in . they turn out as bright as they would in any other food dye . but be careful , it stains everything else , like clothes and upholstery , @entity242 warns . that 's why your tongue changes colors when you drink it . happy @entity0 ! happy @entity128 !\n",
